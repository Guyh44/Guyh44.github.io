    <h1>about rafiki's life:</h1>
<p style="color:#FFFFFF; font-size:130%;">
    It is revealed in the storybook A Tale of Two Brothers that Rafiki was not always a resident of the Pride Lands.<br>
    Years before Mufasa's reign, Rafiki was a traveler studying the African lands who eventually stumbled upon the Pride
    Lands, where he was attacked by a young Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed.<br>
    The mandrill was saved by Ahadi, the then-ruler of the Pride Lands and father of Mufasa and Scar
    (then known as Taka).
<p>
<p style="color:#FFFFFF; font-size:130%;">
    Eventually taking residence in the vast lands, Rafiki would soon become close companions with Mufasa and one day
    overheard Taka's plot to sabotage his brother's reputation, only to be foiled by the mandrill.<br>
    The end results in Taka falling injured, with Rafiki using his abilities to tend to his wounds and heal him,
    though one mark remains on the lion's body - his scar, thus becoming the dangerously-envious Prince Scar.
<p>
<p style="color:#FFFFFF; font-size:130%;">
Rafiki's heroic performance throughout the event leads to Ahadi requesting that the mandrill serves as the adviser to
    all future kings, which Rafiki accepts.
</p>

<h2>Physical Appearance:</h2>
<P style="color:#FFFFFF; font-size:130%;">
    Rafiki is shown as an elderly, slender mandrill. He is shown to be greying, and broken (shown as he walks with his
    staff, using it as a cane).<br>
    He is shown to have a bent tail, is half bald with a white beard, black pupils. His face is shown as pale blue with
    a bright red nose showing.

<h2>Rafiki's love letter to our Rafiki</h2>
<P style="color:#FFFFFF; font-size:130%;">
    My Dearest Rafiki,
    <br>
    As I sit here, pen in hand, my heart races with the urgency of my feelings for you. Words alone cannot capture the depth
    of my emotions, but I will try my best to express what resides within me.
    <br><br>
    From the moment our eyes met, I knew there was something extraordinary about you. Your smile, like a sunbeam
    breaking through the clouds, warmed my soul. Your laughter, a melody that danced in the air, became the soundtrack
    of my days. And your touch—oh, your touch—it ignited a fire within me, consuming every doubt and fear.
    <br><br>
    In your presence, time loses its meaning. We create our own universe, where the stars align just for us.
    Our conversations flow effortlessly, weaving dreams and secrets into a tapestry of shared experiences. You are my
    confidante, my partner in mischief, my compass when I lose my way.
    <br><br>
    I cherish the little things—the way you tuck a strand of hair behind your ear, the crinkle of your nose when you
    laugh, the warmth of your hand in mine. These moments, seemingly insignificant to the world, are etched into my
    memory forever.
    <br><br>
    When we’re apart, I ache for you. The distance feels like an eternity, and I count the seconds until our next
    embrace. Your absence is a symphony of longing, each note resonating through my bones. But when we reunite, it’s
    as if the universe exhales, and I find solace in your arms.
    <br><br>
    My love, you are my muse. You inspire me to be better, to reach for the stars, to create poetry from the mundane.
    With you, I am vulnerable yet invincible. You see the cracks in my armor and love me anyway. You are my safe haven,
    my harbor in life’s tempest.
    <br><br>
    So here I am, pouring my heart onto this paper, hoping that my words can convey even a fraction of what I feel.
    I promise to stand by your side, to weather storms and bask in sunshine. Together, we’ll write our own love
    story—one filled with laughter, passion, and unwavering devotion.
    <br><br>
    Forever yours, <br><br>

    Rafiki
